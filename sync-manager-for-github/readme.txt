Install and keep WordPress plugins updated directly from GitHub releases — supports both public and private repositories.

== Description ==

**GitHub Sync Manager** lets you manage WordPress plugins hosted on GitHub repositories. Instead of manually downloading ZIP files and re-uploading them, this plugin connects to the GitHub API and handles everything for you — including detecting new releases and triggering updates in one click.

**Key Features:**

* Connect your GitHub account via a Personal Access Token (PAT)
* Browse your GitHub repositories and install plugins directly from releases or branches
* Automatic background checks for new releases (via WP-Cron, twice daily)
* Manual "Check for Updates" button to trigger an immediate scan
* Force reinstall any plugin at any time, regardless of version comparison
* Supports public and private GitHub repositories
* Supports subfolder-based plugins (where the plugin lives inside a subdirectory of the repository)
* Activity log for every install, update, and check
* Token encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with keys derived from your `wp-config.php`

**How it works:**

1. Connect your GitHub account with a PAT (fine-grained or classic token)
2. Browse your repositories in the "Add Plugin" tab
3. Install any plugin — the plugin reads the release ZIP or branch archive from GitHub and installs it natively via WordPress's own upgrade infrastructure
4. From that point on, every new release published on GitHub will trigger an update notification in WordPress

**Use case:**

This plugin is designed for developers distributing custom or client plugins via GitHub. Once set up, a new GitHub release automatically makes the update available to all WordPress sites running the plugin — no manual ZIP uploads needed.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest release ZIP from the plugin's GitHub page.
2. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin** and upload the ZIP file.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Go to the new **GitHub Sync** menu item in your WordPress admin sidebar.
5. Enter a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to connect your account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with private repositories? =
Yes. When you provide a Personal Access Token with the appropriate scopes (`repo` for classic tokens, or repository read access for fine-grained tokens), the plugin can access and install from private repositories.

= How are versions compared? =
The plugin compares the tag name of the latest GitHub release (e.g. `v1.2.3`) against the `Version` header declared in the plugin's main PHP file using PHP's `version_compare()`.

= Is my GitHub token stored securely? =
Yes. The token is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from your site's `AUTH_KEY` and `SECURE_AUTH_KEY` constants defined in `wp-config.php`. It is never stored in plain text.

= What if my plugin is inside a subfolder of the repository? =
Supported. When installing, you can select the subfolder where the plugin's main PHP file lives. The plugin will extract only that subfolder during installation.

= Can I install from a branch instead of a release? =
Yes. If a repository has no releases, or you prefer to track a specific branch, you can select a branch as the installation source.

= Does this plugin send any data externally? =
The only external communication is with the GitHub API (`api.github.com`) using your own access token. No data is sent to any other service.
